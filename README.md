# âœ¨My-aiâœ¨

A virtual ai chatbot friend that you chat with and it can answer your any query.
chatbot is conditioned to answer specificaly programing and coding related query.




## implementation
It's using React for the frontend with three.js to display character model.
FlaskÂ serverÂ isÂ usedÂ toÂ handleÂ user'sÂ queryÂ andÂ generateÂ response.  
User's audio is first transcript using Whisper's fast-Whisper implementation with base model and then response is generated with Google's Gemini model,Â  we can use any open source model here with exposed api.  
The generated response is first converted with Tortoise TTS and then converting that audio to realistc voice using RVC , This is by far the best method that give most realistc sounding voice but with cost of time to do this heavy compute.
